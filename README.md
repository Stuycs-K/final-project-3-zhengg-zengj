# MD5 Hash Collision Attack
Gil Zheng, Jaylen Zeng

## About

A Collision attack is when an attacker takes advantage of different inputs returning the same hash. Many websites convert their user's information from plaintext into a more secure hash using some kind of hashing algorithim.

Collision attacks tend to be significantly faster than brute force attacks, with some computers being able to crack hashes in seconds.

We hope to create our own version of a collision attack and share how one might hope to simulate it.
