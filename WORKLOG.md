# Work Log

## Jaylen Zeng

### 5-17-23
- Wrote initial project description in README

### 5-18-23
- More preliminary research on hash collision attacks. Looked at MD5/SHA-1 variations.
- Consider covering hash collisions for less powerful hash algorithms (less bits)

### 5-19-23
- Switch from hash collisions to MD5 algorithm
- Began researching on MD5 algorithm --> found examples and implementations online

### 5-20-23 : 5-21-23
- Began programming MD5 message padding

### 5-22-23
- Finished message padding

### 5-23-23
- Finished splitting longer messages into 512 bit chunks
- Started main loop

## Gil Zheng

### 5-18-23
- Research on hash collisions in order to create a viable project.
- Found different methods such as hashclash, but unsure of practicability

### 5-19-23
- Researching MD5 algorithm; changed proj README

### 5-22-23 : 5-23-24
- Worked on the presentation aspect of the project
