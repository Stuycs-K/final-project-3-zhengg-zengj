# MD5

## Background of MD5
MD5, known as Message-Digest 5, is a hash algorithm created in 1991 by Ronald Rivest to replace its predecessor MD4.  
MD5, like the majority of hash function, is a one way encryption method used for authenticating digital signatures via checksums.
However, MD5 is no longer consider a cryptographic hash as it is vulnerable to hash collisions -- where two strings have the same hash value.  


##How it works
MD5 takes in a string and turns it into 512-bit blocks.
